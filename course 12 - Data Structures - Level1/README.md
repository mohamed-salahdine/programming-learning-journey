# Course 12: Data Structures - Level1

### Course Overview
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud  
**Platform:** [ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com/)  
**Position in Roadmap:** Twelfth course – Introduction to fundamental data structures

This course introduces the essential data structures that form the building blocks of efficient programs. Implemented in C++, it teaches how to organize and manage data effectively beyond basic arrays, enabling solutions to more complex and realistic problems.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Understanding the need for advanced data structures
- Linked lists: singly, doubly, and circular variations
- Operations: insertion, deletion, traversal, searching
- Stacks: implementation and real-world applications (LIFO)
- Queues: standard, circular, and priority queues (FIFO)
- Practical implementation using pointers and dynamic memory
- Comparing built-in vs. custom data structure trade-offs
- Applying data structures to solve algorithmic challenges

### Core Takeaways
- Mastered implementing flexible, dynamic data collections from scratch
- Learned how proper data organization dramatically improves code efficiency and clarity
- Gained deep insight into memory management through pointer-based structures
- Understood classic use cases like undo operations (stack) and task scheduling (queue)
- Successfully applied these structures to enhance solutions from earlier problem-solving courses

### Skills Acquired
- Custom implementation of linked lists, stacks, and queues in C++
- Dynamic memory allocation and pointer manipulation
- Data structure design and selection
- Efficient data organization and access patterns
- Foundation for advanced algorithms and software systems
- Problem-solving with appropriate data representation
