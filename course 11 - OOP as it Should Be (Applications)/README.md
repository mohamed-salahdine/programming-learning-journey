# Course 11: OOP as it Should Be (Applications)

### Course Overview
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud  
**Platform:** [ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com/)  
**Position in Roadmap:** Eleventh course – Practical application of OOP principles

This course takes the pure conceptual foundation from Course 10 and applies it directly in C++ code. It focuses on implementing OOP correctly and effectively, emphasizing clean design, real-world modeling, and professional coding practices that produce maintainable and scalable software.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Implementing classes, objects, and proper encapsulation in C++
- Constructors, destructors, and object lifecycle management
- Inheritance: single, multiple, and proper hierarchy design
- Polymorphism through virtual functions and abstract classes
- Composition and aggregation for flexible relationships
- Applying SOLID principles in actual code
- Designing systems with clear separation of concerns
- Refactoring procedural code into well-structured OOP
- Building medium-sized projects using OOP architecture

### Core Takeaways
- Successfully translated abstract OOP concepts into robust, working C++ code
- Learned to design classes that accurately model real-world entities and behaviors
- Mastered techniques for writing flexible, extensible, and reusable code
- Understood the real-world impact of good vs. poor OOP design on maintainability
- Gained confidence in building organized, professional-grade applications from scratch

### Skills Acquired
- Practical OOP implementation in C++
- Class design and object lifecycle management
- Inheritance and polymorphism in practice
- Composition over inheritance decision-making
- SOLID-compliant code architecture
- System-level design and refactoring
- Building maintainable medium-scale applications
