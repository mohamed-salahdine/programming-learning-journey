# Course 10: OOP as it Should Be (Concepts)

### Course Overview
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud  
**Platform:** [ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com/)  
**Position in Roadmap:** Tenth course – First deep dive into Object-Oriented Programming

This course introduces Object-Oriented Programming the right way: focusing purely on **core concepts** and principles before any language-specific syntax. It teaches how to think in objects, design clean systems, and model real-world problems effectively — laying the foundation for professional software design.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Core pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Understanding classes vs. objects and real-world modeling
- Information hiding and data protection
- Abstraction through interfaces and behavior-focused design
- Inheritance hierarchies and code reuse (is-a relationships)
- Polymorphism: compile-time and runtime behavior
- Composition vs. inheritance (has-a relationships)
- SOLID principles introduction and their importance
- Common design pitfalls and how to avoid them

### Core Takeaways
- Completely shifted from procedural to object-oriented thinking — now design systems around objects and responsibilities
- Learned that good OOP leads to maintainable, scalable, and reusable code
- Understood why blindly applying OOP patterns can harm code, and how to use them purposefully
- Gained ability to model real-world domains accurately and elegantly
- Appreciated that true OOP mastery is about design philosophy, not just syntax

### Skills Acquired
- Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)
- Strong conceptual understanding of OOP pillars
- System modeling using classes and relationships
- Clean architecture mindset
- Foundation for applying OOP correctly in any language
- Critical thinking about code organization and maintainability
