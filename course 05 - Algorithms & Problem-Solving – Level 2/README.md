# Course 05: Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 2

### Course Overview
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud  
**Platform:** [ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com/)  
**Position in Roadmap:** Fifth course – Building on foundational problem-solving skills

This course advances algorithmic thinking by introducing more complex problems that require deeper analysis and creative solutions. It challenges learners to apply the structured approach from earlier courses to scenarios demanding greater logical reasoning and efficiency awareness.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Solving intermediate-level algorithmic problems
- Exploring multiple solution strategies for the same problem
- Introducing basic concepts of time and space complexity (without formal Big-O yet)
- Enhancing flowchart and pseudocode skills for intricate logic
- Handling nested conditions and loops effectively
- Developing robustness in edge-case and boundary-condition thinking
- Practicing systematic testing of solutions

### Core Takeaways
- Gained ability to tackle problems that initially seem overwhelming by breaking them into sub-problems
- Learned the value of considering efficiency early, even in simple implementations
- Improved significantly in designing clear, step-by-step logic before coding
- Built greater confidence and patience in the problem-solving process

### Skills Acquired
- Intermediate problem decomposition
- Multi-strategy solution design
- Early efficiency awareness
- Advanced flowchart and pseudocode proficiency
- Robust logical reasoning with edge cases
- Independent intermediate-level algorithmic thinking
