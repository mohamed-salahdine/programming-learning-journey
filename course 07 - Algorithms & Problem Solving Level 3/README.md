# Course 07: Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 3

### Course Overview
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud  
**Platform:** [ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com/)  
**Position in Roadmap:** Seventh course – Significant leap in problem-solving complexity

This course represents a major milestone in the roadmap, featuring 51 challenging problems plus two mini-projects that simulate real-world programming scenarios. It pushes learners to combine all previously acquired skills — logic, flowcharts, pseudocode, and C++ fundamentals — to solve substantial, multi-step problems independently.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Solving 51 progressively difficult algorithmic problems
- Designing and implementing two complete mini-projects from scratch
- Mastering complex nested logic, loops, and conditional structures
- Handling multi-phase problems requiring planning and modular thinking
- Applying arrays, functions, and basic data organization effectively
- Developing robust testing strategies for comprehensive solutions
- Translating detailed requirements into efficient, working code

### Core Takeaways
- Achieved a breakthrough in independent problem-solving — tackling problems that initially seemed daunting
- Learned to manage larger codebases with proper structure and modularity
- Gained real confidence in turning abstract requirements into functional programs
- Understood how professional developers approach medium-scale challenges step by step
- Solidified all prior concepts through intensive, practical application

### Skills Acquired
- Advanced algorithmic problem-solving
- Independent design and implementation of mini-projects
- Complex control flow and logic management
- Modular code organization in C++
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Real-world simulation of development workflow
