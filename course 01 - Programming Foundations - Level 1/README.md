# Course 01: Programming Foundations - Level 1

### Course Overview
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud  
**Platform:** [ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com/)  
**Position in Roadmap:** First course – Essential groundwork before any coding

This foundational course focuses on developing a deep understanding of how computers work and how to think like a programmer — **without writing a single line of code yet**. It builds the mental framework required for efficient learning of programming languages and problem-solving.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Understand what a program really is and how computers execute instructions
- Difference between source code, compilation/interpretation, and machine code
- High-level vs low-level languages and their trade-offs
- Role of the operating system in program execution
- Memory fundamentals: RAM, variables, addresses, and data representation
- Internal program flow and execution mechanics
- Cultivating the correct programmer mindset and systematic thinking

### Core Takeaways
- Gained clarity on **why** things work in programming, not just **how** to write syntax
- Learned that strong conceptual foundations dramatically reduce debugging time and frustration in later stages
- Appreciated the importance of understanding memory and execution flow for writing efficient, reliable code
- Developed a structured approach to breaking down problems before implementing solutions

### Skills Acquired
- Systems thinking in programming
- Mental modeling of program execution
- Strong conceptual base for learning any programming language efficiently
