# Course 02: Algorithms & Problem-Solving Level 1

### Course Overview
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud  
**Platform:** [ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com/)  
**Position in Roadmap:** Second course – First dedicated focus on algorithmic thinking

This course introduces the core principles of algorithms and problem-solving — the essential skill that separates effective programmers from beginners. It teaches how to break down real-world problems systematically **before** writing any code, using tools like flowcharts, pseudocode, and step-by-step reasoning.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Understanding what an algorithm is and why it matters
- Problem decomposition: breaking complex problems into manageable steps
- Flowchart fundamentals and visual representation of logic
- Writing clear pseudocode as a bridge between thought and code
- Common algorithmic patterns (sequential, conditional, repetitive)
- Input → Processing → Output model
- Developing logical thinking and structured problem-solving habits

### Core Takeaways
- Learned to approach problems methodically instead of jumping straight into coding
- Mastered translating real-life problems into clear, logical steps using flowcharts and pseudocode
- Gained confidence in planning solutions thoroughly — reducing errors and rework in later coding stages
- Recognized that strong problem-solving skills are language-agnostic and form the backbone of all programming

### Skills Acquired
- Structured problem decomposition
- Flowchart design and interpretation
- Pseudocode writing for clear logic expression
- Logical reasoning and algorithmic mindset
- Foundation for tackling increasingly complex challenges
