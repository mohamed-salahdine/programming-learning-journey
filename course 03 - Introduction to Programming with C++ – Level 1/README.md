# Course 03: Introduction to Programming with C++ – Level 1

### Course Overview
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud  
**Platform:** [ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com/)  
**Position in Roadmap:** Third course – First hands-on programming experience

This course marks the transition from theory to practice, introducing programming concepts through C++ as the first language. It focuses on writing, compiling, and running actual code while reinforcing the foundational mindset and problem-solving skills from previous courses.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Setting up a C++ development environment
- Structure of a basic C++ program (main function, headers, syntax)
- Variables, data types, and declarations
- Input and output operations (cin, cout)
- Basic operators: arithmetic, relational, logical
- Conditional statements (if, if-else, switch)
- Loops (while, do-while, for)
- Writing clean, readable, and well-commented code
- Compiling and debugging simple programs

### Core Takeaways
- Successfully wrote and executed my first C++ programs with confidence
- Understood how theoretical concepts (like input-processing-output) translate directly into real code
- Learned the importance of proper syntax, structure, and early debugging habits
- Reinforced problem-solving by implementing algorithmic ideas from Course 02 in actual code

### Skills Acquired
- C++ fundamentals and basic syntax
- Program compilation and execution workflow
- Input/output handling
- Control structures (conditionals and loops)
- Writing structured and maintainable beginner-level code
- Basic debugging and error resolution
