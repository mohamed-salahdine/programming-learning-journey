# Course 06: Introduction to Programming Using C++ Level 2

### Course Overview
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud  
**Platform:** [ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com/)  
**Position in Roadmap:** Sixth course – Deepening practical C++ skills

This course builds directly on Level 1 by introducing more advanced fundamental concepts in C++, enabling the implementation of complex logic and real-world problem-solving patterns. It bridges basic syntax with intermediate programming techniques essential for larger programs.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Arrays (1D and 2D) and multi-dimensional data handling
- Strings and string manipulation functions
- Functions: declaration, definition, parameters, return values, and recursion basics
- Pointers fundamentals and memory addressing
- Structs and custom data types
- Scope, lifetime, and storage classes
- Practical projects combining loops, conditions, arrays, and functions
- Writing modular, reusable, and well-organized code

### Core Takeaways
- Gained proficiency in handling collections of data efficiently using arrays and strings
- Mastered functions as building blocks for clean, maintainable code
- Developed a solid grasp of pointers — demystifying a traditionally challenging topic
- Learned to structure programs modularly, preparing for larger-scale development
- Successfully implemented intermediate-level problems from earlier algorithm courses in actual C++ code

### Skills Acquired
- Advanced C++ data structures (arrays, strings)
- Function design and modular programming
- Pointer basics and memory management awareness
- Custom types using structs
- Code organization and reusability
- Intermediate C++ implementation of algorithmic solutions
