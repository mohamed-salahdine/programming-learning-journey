### Roadmap Overview

### Overview
This repository documents my ongoing journey through one of the most rigorous and well-structured programming roadmaps available today. Designed by Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud, the 24-course curriculum builds **professional-grade software engineering skills** progressively — from deep conceptual foundations to full-stack application development.

The roadmap is divided into two stages:
- **Stage 1** (Courses 1–13): Mastering problem-solving, C++, OOP, data structures, and systems thinking
- **Stage 2** (Courses 14–24): Transitioning to C#, databases, advanced OOP, and building real-world projects (including the capstone DVLD system)

### Why This Roadmap
This curriculum stands out for its emphasis on:
- **Depth over speed** – Understanding "why" before "how"
- **Progressive complexity** – Hundreds of hand-crafted problems building true algorithmic maturity
- **Clean, professional code** – Heavy focus on design, modularity, and maintainability
- **Real-world readiness** – Culminating in a complete database-driven application

### Current Progress
- **Stage 1 (Courses 1–13)**: Fully completed  
  Strong foundation in algorithmic thinking, C++, object-oriented design, memory management, and custom data structures
- **Stage 2**: Actively in progress  
  Currently advancing into C#, SQL, database integration, and full project development

### Key Skills Developed So Far
- Advanced problem-solving and algorithmic design
- Proficient C++ implementation (procedural and object-oriented)
- Deep understanding of program execution, memory, and performance
- Object-Oriented Analysis & Design (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, SOLID principles)
- Custom data structure implementation (linked lists, stacks, queues)
- Structured thinking: flowcharts, pseudocode, modular architecture
- Independent learning, debugging, and code organization

### Future Goals
Complete Stage 2, including:
- C# mastery and modern language features
- Database design and T-SQL
- Full-stack application development
- Capstone project: DVLD (Driver and Vehicle Licensing Department) system

Thank you for taking the time to review my work.  
I'm passionate about writing robust, well-designed software and eager to apply these skills in a professional environment.

🚀 Open to opportunities in software engineering, backend development, or full-stack roles.
