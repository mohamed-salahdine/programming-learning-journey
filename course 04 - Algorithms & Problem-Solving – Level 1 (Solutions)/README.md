# Course 04: Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 1 (Solutions)

### Course Overview
**Instructor:** Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud  
**Platform:** [ProgrammingAdvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com/)  
**Position in Roadmap:** Fourth course – Detailed solutions to Level 1 problems

This course provides comprehensive solutions and detailed explanations for all the problems introduced in Course 02. It emphasizes understanding the optimal approaches, common pitfalls, and multiple ways to solve the same problem effectively.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Analyzing complete solutions to algorithmic problems from Course 02
- Understanding multiple approaches to the same problem
- Learning optimal vs. acceptable solutions and their trade-offs
- Recognizing common mistakes and debugging patterns
- Deepening pseudocode and flowchart interpretation skills
- Developing the ability to evaluate solution quality and efficiency
- Building confidence in tackling similar problems independently

### Core Takeaways
- Saw how real expert solutions balance simplicity, efficiency, and readability
- Learned to identify suboptimal approaches and improve them systematically
- Gained insight into the thought process behind professional problem-solving
- Reinforced that understanding *why* a solution works is more valuable than memorizing it
